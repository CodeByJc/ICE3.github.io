          <strong>Digital Modulation</strong> Digital Modulation is the process
          of encoding digital data into a carrier wave for transmission over
          communication channels. It plays a critical role in modern
          communication systems by ensuring reliable data transfer. Digital
          modulation helps in various ways such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enabling efficient use of bandwidth by adjusting the carrier wave's
            characteristics to transmit more data in the same frequency
            spectrum.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving resistance to noise and interference, allowing digital
            signals to maintain integrity over long distances and through
            various transmission mediums.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting high-speed data transfer, making it essential for modern
            applications like mobile communication, internet, and satellite
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhancing data security through techniques like Phase Shift Keying
            (PSK), which can be used to encode data in a way that is more
            difficult for unauthorized users to intercept or decode.

        <h3>Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)</h3>
        <p class="description">
          <strong>Description:</strong> Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a
          digital modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier wave
          is varied in accordance with the digital signal. It is a simple and
          widely used modulation scheme in communication systems. ASK helps in
          various ways such as:
        </p>
        <strong>Application:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Efficiently encoding binary data by representing digital 1s and 0s
            with high and low amplitudes of the carrier wave, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplifying transmitter and receiver design, as ASK requires less
            complex hardware compared to other modulation techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing easy implementation in low-frequency communication
            systems, such as in basic data transmission applications like Morse
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being susceptible to noise, making it less reliable in noisy
            environments, but still useful in short-range, low-data-rate
            applications.

          is varied according to the digital signal. It is commonly used in

          </li>
          <li>
            Allowing for secure data transmission, as frequency variations are
            harder to intercept or decode than amplitude changes.
