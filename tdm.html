      <div class="description-section">
        <p>
          <strong>Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)</strong> is a fundamental
          multiplexing technique used in digital communication systems. It
          enables multiple signals to share a single transmission medium by
          assigning each signal a unique time slot. This method ensures that
          signals do not overlap and makes efficient use of bandwidth resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          TDM is extensively employed in various communication systems, such as
          telecommunication networks, to transmit data, voice, and video
          efficiently. By dividing time into discrete intervals, it facilitates
          the sequential transmission of data streams from different sources
          over a single channel.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allows multiple signals to transmit over a single communication
            channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimizes bandwidth utilization and minimizes data transmission
            delays.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used in applications such as telecommunication, digital TV
            broadcasting, and satellite communication.

        <h3>Types of TDM</h3>

        <!-- Synchronous TDM -->
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h4>Synchronous TDM</h4>
          <p class="description">
            <strong>Description:</strong> Synchronous TDM divides time into
            fixed slots that are pre-assigned to specific channels. Each channel
            gets a dedicated time slot, regardless of whether it has data to
            transmit. While this approach ensures predictable transmission, it
            can lead to inefficiency when channels are idle.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, in traditional telephone networks, Synchronous TDM was
            used to assign specific time slots to telephone calls. Even if one
            caller remained silent, their time slot was still reserved and left
            unused.
          </p>
          <p class="application">
            <strong>Application:</strong> Commonly used in early
            telecommunication systems and circuit-switched networks where
            predictable timing was essential.

        <!-- Asynchronous TDM -->
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h4>Asynchronous TDM</h4>
          <p class="description">
            <strong>Description:</strong> Asynchronous TDM, also called
            Statistical TDM, dynamically allocates time slots based on the
            activity of each channel. Unlike Synchronous TDM, this method does
            not assign time slots to idle channels, thus improving efficiency
            and bandwidth utilization.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, in modern packet-switched networks, Asynchronous TDM
            ensures that active users receive the time slots they need while
            idle users do not occupy any slots. This dynamic allocation
            significantly reduces waste and supports higher data rates for
            active users.
          </p>
          <p class="application">
            <strong>Application:</strong> Widely used in modern communication
            systems, such as internet data transmission and wireless
            communication networks, where traffic is bursty and unpredictable.
